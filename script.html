        <h2>The Heavenly Gate Race Story - Reasons for Zodiac Rankings</h2>
        <p>Long, long ago, there was no Chinese zodiac. The Jade Emperor wanted to select 12 animals to be his guards.
            He sent an immortal being into man's world to spread the message that the earlier one went through the
            Heavenly Gate, the better the rank one would have. <br>
            The next day, animals set off towards the Heavenly Gate. Rat got up very early. On his way to the gate, he
            encountered a river. He had to stop there, owing to the swift current. After waiting a long time, Rat noticed Ox
            about to cross the river and swiftly jumped into Ox's ear.<br>
            The diligent Ox did not mind at all and simply continued. After crossing the river, he raced towards the palace of
            the Jade Emperor. Suddenly, Rat jumped out of Ox's ear and dashed to the feet of the Emperor. Rat won
            first place and Ox was second.<br>
            Tiger and Rabbit came third and fourth because both are fast and competitive, but Tiger was faster. (Rabbit got
            across the river by hopping on stepping stones and a floating log.)<br>
            Good-looking Dragon was fifth and was immediately noticed by the Jade Emperor, who said Dragon's son could
            be sixth. But Dragon's son didn't come with him that day. Just then, Snake came forward and said Dragon was
            his adoptive father; so Snake ranked sixth.<br>
            Horse and Goat arrived. They were very kind and modest and each let the other go first. The Jade Emperor
            saw how polite they were and ranked them seventh and eighth.<br>
            Monkey had fallen well behind. But he jumped between trees and stones, and caught up to be ninth. Last were
            Rooster, Dog, and Pig.<br>
            These 12 animals became guards of the Heavenly Gate.<br>
